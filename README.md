# Welcome to my profile I guess<br><br>

What do I do?<br>
Well you tell me, I work on multiple projects either open source or closed.<br>
It depends on what I feel like doing.<br><br>


## FAQ???... Fine<br><br>

### **What open source projects do you maintain?**<br>
Usually my own work, I don't really work on other people's projects unless I was already apart of the project.<br><br>

### **Why does your profile look empty?**<br>
Well I keep a lot of projects private as I simply don't want people to steal my work and claim it as their own.<br><br>
It has happened in the past and I simply don't want it to happen again. I do release open source projects but that usually comes in the form of a custom framework that you can't remove my copyright information from.<br><br>

### **Why don't you commit on GitHub as it looks empty?**<br>
Most of my projects go through extensive testing before I commit it to GitHub,<br>
I run a separate Git Source Control to manage and store releases being worked on.<br><br>

### **These tests usually start off with:**<br>
 Can it build?<br>
 Does it work after the build?<br>
 How many dependencies can I remove before it breaks to ensure a small project size while remaining functional?<br>
 Does the built project break randomly?<br><br>

If it fails my checklist, I usually rework it or workaround. Once an update passes then I commit to GitHub<br><br>

### **How long does it take for you to release work?**<br>
Honestly, It's not as simple as that question seems to the average person,<br>
It's probably better to wait for releases instead of asking how long it takes.<br><br>

If I had to answer the question every hour of the day then I wouldn't have time to work.<br><br>

### **Can I hire you to work on a project?**<br>
No. I don't get hired, If you want to start a project with me then I say fine but don't expect me to actively commit changes every minute, I take time to work on things.
